## NanoUI Static Files

These never change while the game is running, and reloading of these files is not supported while the server is live.

## Templates

These use the [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) templating language.

If you're using VSCode, then click on the `plain text` button on the bottom right, and set the file association for `.tmpl` to be `handlebars`.
